# Overview

# First CNN Example
MNIST dataset is probably the most popular for create the first CNN example. It consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits from 0-9.

Depending on your preference of the programming languages, there are Python and Matlab examples available.
* Python: [Building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Keras](https://towardsdatascience.com/building-a-convolutional-neural-network-cnn-in-keras-329fbbadc5f5){:target="_blank"}. If you are using Python, you need to properly install software and configure your environments.
* Matlab: [Create Simple Deep Learning Network for Classification](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/deeplearning/ug/create-simple-deep-learning-network-for-classification.html). The Matlab Deep Learning Toolbox needs to be installed before you run the example.
