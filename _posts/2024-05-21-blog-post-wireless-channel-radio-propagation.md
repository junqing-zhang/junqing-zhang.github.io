# Overview

# Wireless Channel
* The channel effect includes large scale fading (path loss and shadowing) and small scale fading (multipath). Please refer to the communication textbook by Professor Andrea Goldsmith: [Wireless Communications](http://web.stanford.edu/class/ee359/doc/WirelessComm_Chp1-16_March32020.pdf){:target="_blank"}, for more details (Chapter 2 and Chapter 3). 

* Chapters 1-3 of [MIMO-OFDM Wireless Communications with MATLAB](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9780470825631){:target="_blank"}. Matlab codes are available.

# Antenna
* Cisco Technical Report: [Omni Antenna vs. Directional Antenna](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/wireless-mobility/wireless-lan-wlan/82068-omni-vs-direct.html){:target="_blank"}
* Cisco Technical Report: [Antenna Patterns and Their Meaning](https://www.industrialnetworking.com/pdf/Antenna-Patterns.pdf){:target="_blank"}

# Matlab Resources
Matlab has provided lots of useful resources.
* Matlab has modeled the fading channels, which can be found [here](https://www.mathworks.com/help/comm/ug/fading-channels.html){:target="_blank"}
* [Propagation Channel Models for WiFi/IEEE 802.11](https://www.mathworks.com/help/wlan/propagation-channel-models.html){:target="_blank"}
