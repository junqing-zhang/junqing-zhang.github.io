University of Liverpool has been one of the leading institutions worldwide in the area of _key generation from wireless channels_. We have carried out systematic research to investigate different aspects of this exciting technique, ranging from theoretical modelling, simulation, and experimental validations. This page summarizes our key generation publication.
