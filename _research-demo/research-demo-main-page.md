We are always keen to apply our knowledge to practical applications. Hence we have created several demonstration videos to present our applied research.

# Radio Frequency Fingerprint Identification
* [WiFi RFFI Demonstration](/research-demo/demo-wifi-rffi/)
* [Deep Learning-Powered Radio Frequency Fingerprint Identification for LoRa](/research-demo/demo-fyp-2020-rffi-lora/)

# Key Generation
* [WiFi Key Generation Demonstration using WARP](/research-demo/demo-keygen-warp/)
* [WiFi Key Generation Demonstration using Raspberry Pi](/research-demo/demo-keygen-rpi/)
* [Heartbeat Key Generation Demonstration Using PPG Sensors](/research-demo/demo-keygen-heartbeat-ppg/)

# Internet of Things (IoT)
